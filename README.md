# Probability-Methods-In-AI-
This repo contains my projects in Probability methods in AI course taken in HUJI. 

EX1 contains the first exercise, which is about building an HMM class, and predict the Prior, Likelihood and Posterior.
and after that indentifying corrupted data with the model.

EX2 contains contains the second project. I used the class from the last project for sampling based inference, and realize Gibbs sampling 
and Likelihood Weightning.

EX3 contains the third project. In the last exercises we used the given CPDs to perform various inference tasks. In this priject , we want to use data to learn the model parameters.
There are two learning methods, the first one will be over full data and will based on MLE, the second one will be over missing data, and we will use the EM method.

EX4 contains the fourth project. In this project we used reinforcment learning techniques to solve a maze game - "the fish pond". We implemented q-learning algorithm over offline and online
learning methods.
